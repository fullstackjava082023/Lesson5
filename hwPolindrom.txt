-- create an array of numbers: 1, 3, 5, 8, 8, 5, 3, 1
-- check if the array is a polindrom (which in this case it is)
-- polindrom = all elements are repeated in a reverse order:
-- here it is polidrom since --> 1 3 5 8 are reverse equal to 8 5 3 1
-- another polindrom: 3 4 6 9 9 6 4 3
-- not polindrom: 1 3 5 6 5 3 1 --> since 6 is not repeated
